## Usefulness
In most websites about video game (like IGN and IGDB), users can only see the information about the games, e.g. the publisher, rate, themes, genres, and so on. However, users can hardly find friends with common interests through this kind of websites. For ArrowInTheKnee, we first contain all the functions other websites have, including detailed information of video games and recommendations for users. Whatâ€™s more, we strengthen the social function. Based on the games a user have liked, our system helps him or her find a friend with common interests and chating is also available through ArrowInTheKnee.

## Recommendation
Based on the games in user's favourite list, how the user rates games, and how long the user stays in a particular page of games, calculate the *InterestValue* of each feature for this user (how much a particular feature interests the user). Based on the result, system will recommend games and users with commen interests.
